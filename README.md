IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining
whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. In this project, we will
analyze movie reviews from the IMDb dataset and predict the sentiment (positive or
negative) based on the text of the reviews. By leveraging various text preprocessing
techniques, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms, this project will
develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of movie
reviews. The insights derived from this analysis can be useful for movie producers, critics,
and platforms like IMDb to understand public opinion and tailor marketing or content
strategies accordingly.
